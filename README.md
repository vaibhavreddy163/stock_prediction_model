## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled "Microsoft Stock Forecasting.ipynb" that showcases the development and evaluation of a stock price prediction model for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). The model is built using historical stock price data and aims to forecast the closing prices of MSFT stocks.

## Model Overview

The model in the notebook is constructed using various data processing and machine learning techniques. The primary steps involved in the development of the model are:

- **Data Loading:** Loading historical stock price data from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for training the model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generating relevant features that will aid in the prediction task.
- **Model Building:** Creating and training a prediction model using the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
